# HI-MC code & demos
The [HI-MC project](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10665380) aims to reconstruct 10mm^3 of the mouse hippocampal formation using EM connectomics. This repository contains sample code for analysis of data relevant to this project, principally using tools first developed by the [Drosophila Connectomics Group](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/connectomics) in Cambridge for flies and now being adapted for larger brains.

### Examples

- [examples/allen_fmost_ingest](https://github.com/flyconnectome/hi-mc/blob/main/examples/allen_fmost_ingest.ipynb) shows ingest of Allen fMOST data
- [examples/allen_fmost_transform](https://github.com/flyconnectome/hi-mc/blob/main/examples/allen_fmost_transform.ipynb) demos transforms of neurons in Allen fMOST space to a uCT volume
- [examples/qiu2024_nblast](https://github.com/flyconnectome/hi-mc/blob/main/examples/qiu2024_nblast.ipynb) runs an all-by-all NBLAST for ~4k neurons of the [Qiu et al. (2024)](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adj9198) [HPF dataset](https://mouse.digital-brain.cn/hipp), see also [Dryad dataset](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.wh70rxwv4)
